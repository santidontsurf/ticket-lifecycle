<h1>osTicket - Ticket Lifecycle Examples</h1>
This tutorial simulates end-user creation of a ticket and the agent side of ticket response.<br />


<h2>Ticket Creation & Response</h2>

<p>
</p>
<p>First, we will be creating a ticket from the end-user perspective by going to the Support Center Ticketing System with the link: http://localhost/osTicket and in there we can click "Open A New Ticket".</p>

</p>
<br />
<p>In this new page, we will submit a ticket as Ken, one of the users we created. Add Ken's email address and name, and choose "Report a Problem/Business Critical Outage" as the Help Topic. For the Issue Summary type "Entire online banking system is down" and for the notes type "My employees are reporting that users are no longer able to access the online banking system, and that those who do can't log in" then click "Create Ticket" at the bottom.</p>
